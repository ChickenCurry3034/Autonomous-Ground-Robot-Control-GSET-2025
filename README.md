# **PID Control Optimization and Trajectory Tracking for Autonomous Ground Robots**
This project offers a deep analysis of PID controls for differential drive robots, such as the TurtleBot3 which was used for this study. The traditional PID requires that a robot can control all three degrees of freedom independently, but that is impossible with a differential drive. This novel method allows differential drives to reach all its x, y, and yaw targets within a two-dimensional space, tested on both Python with the TurtleBot and MATLAB simulations. This also offers cheaper, durable, and more energy-efficient drivetrains to be just as effective as more complex and expensive drivetrains such as omnidirectional drives, allowing PIDs to be universally used in the real world across all applications of autonomous rovers. This methodology was tested with the A* and Dijkstra algorithms to see if the robot's path tracking is consistent with following a more complex path with multiple waypoints, along with determining which path generation algorithm is more efficient over the other in specific situations.
